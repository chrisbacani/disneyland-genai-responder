# Disneyland Guest Review Summarization & Response Pipeline

This project builds a GenAI-powered system to automatically process and respond to Disneyland guest reviews.

### What It Does
1. **Summarizes** long or noisy reviews using Hugging Faceâ€™s BART model
2. **Analyzes sentiment** (Positive/Negative) using a classification pipeline
3. **Generates responses**:
   - Rule-based fallback for offline testing
   - GPT-3.5-driven responses that adapt tone, reference details, and stay on-brand

### Example Output

**Input Review**  
_"It was a shame that so much of the park was closed when we visited, but the parades were amazing!"_

**Summary**  
"Much of the park was closed, but parades were amazing."

**Sentiment**  
`NEGATIVE`

**Final Response (via OpenAI)**  
_"Weâ€™re sorry to hear about the closures during your visit. Weâ€™re thrilled you enjoyed the parades and hope to welcome you back for an even more magical experience. Have a magical day! â€“ Jenna, Disneyland Guest Services"_
